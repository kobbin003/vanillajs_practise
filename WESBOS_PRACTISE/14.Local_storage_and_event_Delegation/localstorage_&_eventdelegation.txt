     <shorthand property>
--- > if you want to define an object who's keys have the same name as the variables 
      passed-in as properties, you can use the shorthand and simply pass the key name.
      E.g var x=3;
          var obj = { x:x }; ---> var obj = {x};


     < form_element.reset() >
--- > resets the text on the < input type="text" >, after the submit/enter have been
      pressed.


     < DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FORLOOP AND MAP() >
--- > In case of <for loop>, the latest indexed 'text' replaces the precedent 
      index 'text',
      While,
      Map fills the element with an array i.e the whole set of the array items.
      Therefore,
               For loop fills with only the latest text input, while
               Map fills with all the text inputs. 

* * * * * . here every time we input a 'text' the map/for loop is being runned/executed.
            i.e a new list is not added every time we "input", but the whole list is 
                recreated from beginning to end.(..altough it looks like only one is 
                added)
              This may effect when there is input of higher scale.

        x = items of the array_to_be_mapped;
        i = index of x;  

     Note: observe how the "i" is used for "id" and "for" in the <input> and <label>,
           repectively.

    IN CASE OF setItem:
     x = the name of the key where the object/item is to be stored.
     Y = the item/object.
         Y has to be converted into JSON string by JSON.stringify(y).
    *** localStorage.Clear();  -> clears the data saved.

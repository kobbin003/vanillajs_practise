--> <label><input></label>

-->query selector inside forEach();

-->this.checked.

-->e.shiftKey

--> how to associate "for" and "id"---> in the /*...*/ section.

ORIGINAL SOLUTION
--> forEach inside function.i.e inside "handlecheck()"

--> see the difference the position of var lastchecked,i.e before and after the if(e.shiftKey) loop, makes in the outcome.

--> see how "inBetween" is used...

CSS
-->css:checked{}

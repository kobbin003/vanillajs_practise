-multiple linear-gradient:
> it works on background , not on background-color.
> Use this technique of "fade-to-white" for every layer.
> Here, every linear-gradient forms a layer on top of each other, just like photoshop.
> linear-gradient(angle, from-color x%, to-color y%)
x=100 ===> background color= from-colour.
y=0 ===> background color= to-color.
I.e more the "x" more will be the from-colour and more the "y" less will be the to-color.

-<nav>:
-it is preferable to write nav items as <li> and since it is mostly links, we will use <a> too.
Therefore we will use <nav><li><a></a></li></nav>



-getBoundingClientRect()

-z-index works only on positioned elements.

- see how the background of <a> is transparented to let the span , which is z-indexed below, show up.
